# PrepSharp Admin Dashboard

## How to Access the Admin Dashboard

There are two ways to access the admin dashboard:

### Option 1: Using the Fixed Version (Recommended)
1. Open `admin-dashboard-fixed.html` directly in your browser
2. This version works without requiring Firebase authentication
3. All data is pre-populated for demonstration purposes

### Option 2: Using the Original Version
1. Open `admin-login.html` in your browser
2. Enter any email and password
3. You will be redirected to `admin-dashboard.html`

## GitHub Integration
When pushing to GitHub, include both versions of the dashboard:
- `admin-dashboard.html` (original version with Firebase)
- `admin-dashboard-fixed.html` (simplified version that works without authentication)

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the admin dashboard:
1. Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
3. Use the fixed version if Firebase authentication is causing problems
