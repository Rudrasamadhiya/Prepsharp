# PrepSharp Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the PrepSharp webapp to prevent hacking and unauthorized access.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication Security
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Rate limiting on login/register endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- Session management with secure cookies
- CSRF protection for all form submissions

### 2. Input Validation
- Server-side validation of all user inputs
- Sanitization of inputs to prevent injection attacks

### 3. HTTP Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent XSS attacks
- X-XSS-Protection header
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Strict-Transport-Security header for HTTPS enforcement

### 4. Session Security
- HttpOnly cookies to prevent JavaScript access
- Secure cookies (in production) to ensure HTTPS-only transmission
- SameSite cookie attribute to prevent CSRF attacks

### 5. CSRF Protection
- CSRF tokens required for all state-changing operations
- Token validation on server side

## How to Use the Secure Server

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with secure values for production:
   ```
   SESSION_SECRET=your-long-random-string
   NODE_ENV=production
   SECURE_COOKIES=true
   ```

3. Start the secure server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   Or use the provided batch file:
   ```
   start-secure-server.bat
   ```

## Client-Side Integration

To work with the secure server, your frontend code needs to:

1. Fetch CSRF token before form submissions:
   ```javascript
   async function getCsrfToken() {
     const response = await fetch('/api/csrf-token');
     const data = await response.json();
     return data.csrfToken;
   }
   ```

2. Include the token in all form submissions:
   ```javascript
   const token = await getCsrfToken();
   
   fetch('/api/login', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'CSRF-Token': token
     },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       email: email,
       password: password
     }),
     credentials: 'same-origin'
   });
   ```

## Security Best Practices for Developers

1. Never store sensitive information in client-side code or localStorage
2. Always validate and sanitize user inputs on both client and server
3. Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
4. Use HTTPS in production
5. Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive details
6. Regularly audit your code for security issues
